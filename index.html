In April 2002, Puneeth made his film debut as a leading man in the film Appu with actress, Rakshita also making her film debut.The musical by Gurukiran, directed by Puri Jagannadh and produced by Parvathamma Rajkumar, 
   in which he played a college boy, was a box office success and critics praised his dancing skills. Puneeth sang "Taliban Alla Alla", with lyrics by Upendra and music by Gurukiran. The film's success spawned remakes in Telugu (Idiot (2002)) and Tamil (Dum (2003)).

Puneeth next appeared in Dinesh Babu's Abhi (2003) as a plucky college boy who is devoted to his mother. In the film, based on a true story and produced by Parvathamma Rajkumar, he starred with debutante Ramya.

Meher Ramesh's Veera Kannadiga was Puneeth's first 2004 release. The film, written by Puri Jagannadh, was simultaneously made in Telugu as Andhrawala with N. T. Rama Rao Jr. in the lead role. Paired with debutante Anitha,
 it showcased his dancing and stunt skills. Although the film was criticised for its violence and poor plot, it was successful at the box office.Puneeth next starred in S. Narayan's family drama Maurya, a remake of the Telugu Amma Nanna O Tamila Ammayi,
  starring Ravi Teja and written by Puri Jagannadh. The remake enhanced Puneeth's reputation as an actor in his own right.
